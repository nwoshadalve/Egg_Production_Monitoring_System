# To Find the Optimum Light Intensity to Get Maximum Egg Production in the Poultry Industry

There are some major factors such as feed consumption, water intake, light intensity, disease, environmental factors, parasite infestation, and numerous management which can affect egg production. So, this work has focused on the impact of light intensity to get maximum egg production. Therefore, we have observed at poultry layers egg production over four weeks in a light-controlled house and collected the light intensity value for the duration of an average of 6-8 hours each day. We have also increased and decreased light intensity after 3-4 days respectively to monitor the egg production at various light intensities. So, our dataset contains light intensities along with dates and times and for observation, we have developed a web application and through the web application, we have recorded per day egg production with respect to a specific date and we have also observed that when light intensity remains 5-15 lux the egg production is higher than light intensity 15-30 lux. For the purpose of predict the egg productions over different light intensities, we have used several machine learning approaches such as linear regression, logistic regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression which provides around 99% of accuracy.
